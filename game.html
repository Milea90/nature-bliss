                    We have created a very simple game for you to play. Spin the wheel and see what type of activity
                    nature has in store for you today. Here is how to play:

                    You HAVE to do what the wheel tells you to do TODAY. Otherwise, bad things will happen... The same
                    goes with
                    cheating. This is what the numbers on the wheel is representing:<br><br>
                    1. Take a powerwalk to a park!<br>
                    2. Run a mile in the nearest forest!<br>
                    3. DO EVERYTHING!<br>
                    4. Go for a bike-ride whereever you prefer!<br>
                    5. DO EVERYTHING!<br>
                    6. Go for a swim in the nearest lake.<br>
                    7. DO EVERYTHING!<br>
                    8. Go hiking an hour!<br><br>

                    Good luck!<br>
