                    What do we mean with the bliss of nature? Well, nature provides the feeling of bliss and joy
                    in so many ways and none of it cost a penny! Time spent in nature is beneficial in many ways, 
                    not just for feeling the feeling of bliss and joy. Some benefits of spending time outdoors are:

                    <ol>
                        <li> You get fresh air filled with oxygen into your lungs</li>
                        <li>The light from the sun makes your body produce vitamin D and melatonin, both which is crucial for your health.</li>
                        <li>Your eyes sees objects far away, which is a good compliment from sitting and staring into a screen all day.</li>
                        <li>You will hear sounds from nature - birds, the wind, waves etc. This types of sound is calming for the body. </li>
                        <li>Spending time in nature gives you a feeling of being free.</li>
                        
                    </ol>

                    So with that said, go outside and just be. You do not have to do anything special outside. Just take a walk or sit down on a bench and relax.
