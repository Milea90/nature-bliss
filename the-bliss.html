                    What do we mean with the bliss of nature? Well, nature provides the feeling of bliss and joy
                    in so many ways and none of them costs a penny! Time spent in nature is beneficial in many ways, 
                    not just for feeling bliss and joy. Some benefits of spending time outdoors are:
                    </p>

                    <ul id="list">
                        <li> You get fresh air filled with oxygen into your lungs.</li>
                        <li>The light from the sun makes your body produce vitamin D and melatonin, both which are crucial for your health.</li>
                        <li>Your eyes sees objects far away, which is a good compliment from sitting and staring into a screen all day.</li>
                        <li>You will hear sounds from nature - birds, the wind, waves etc. This types of sounds are calming for the body. </li>
                        <li>Spending time in nature gives you a feeling of being free.</li>
                        
                    </ul>

                <p>   
                    So with that said, go outside and just be. You do not have to do anything special outside. Just take a walk or sit down on 
                    a bench and relax. And do not mind bad weather, the right type of clothes will protect you. After all, weather is part of nature. 
                    Embrace it!
